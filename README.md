Summary
-------

Git powered FTP client written as shell script.


About
-----

I use git-ftp for my script based projects, mostly PHP. Most of the low-cost
web hosting companies do not provide SSH or git support, but only FTP.

That is why I needed an easy way to deploy my git tracked projects. Instead of
transferring the whole project, I thought, why not only transfer the files
that changed since the last time, git can tell me those files.

Even if you are playing with different branches, git-ftp knows which files
are different. No ordinary FTP client can do that.


Known Issues
------------

* See [git-ftp issues on GitHub] for open issues


Installing
----------

See [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) file.


Usage
-----

``` sh
$ cd my_git_tracked_project
$ git ftp push --user <user> --passwd <password> ftp://host.example.com/public_html
```

For interactive password prompt use `-P`:

``` sh
$ git ftp push -u <user> -P ftp://host.example.com/public_html
```

Pushing for the first time:

``` sh
$ git ftp init -u <user> -P ftp://host.example.com/public_html
```

See [man page](man/git-ftp.1.md) for more options, features and examples!


Limitations
-----------

* Windows and OS X: I am very limited in testing on Windows and OS X. Thanks for helping me out fixing bugs on these platforms.
* git-ftp as deployment tool: git-ftp was not designed as centralized deployment tool. While running git-ftp, you have to take care, no one pushes or touches this repo (e.g. no commits, no checkouts, no file modifications)!


Unit Tested
-----------

Core functionality is unit tested on Linux using shunit2. You can find the tests in `tests/`.
